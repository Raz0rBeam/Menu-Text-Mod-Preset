# Custom Menu Text v3.1.3
# by Arti
# Special Thanks: Kyle1413, Alphie
#
# Use # for comments!
# Separate entries with empty lines; a random one will be picked each time the menu loads.
# Appears just like in the vanilla game (except not quite because the vanilla logo is an image now):
# Entries with a number of lines other than 2 won't be colored by default.
# Color them yourself with formatting!
# You can override the colors even when the text is 2 lines, plus do a lot of other stuff!
# (contributed by @Rolo)

# Hi yall Raz0r here! I hope you enjoy these menu text things. If your looking in here congrats! You're a kool kid!
# Make sure to get the latest menu texts from #pc-mods and the newest texts from #other-files!

The FitnessGram PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
The test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the FitnessGram assessment. Students run back and 
forth as many times as they can, each lap signaled by a beep sound. The test get progressively faster as it 
continues until the student reaches their max lap score.
The PACER Test score is combined in the FitnessGram software with scores for muscular strength, endurance, 
flexibility and body composition to determine whether a student is in the Healthy Fitness Zone™ or the Needs Improvement Zone™.
