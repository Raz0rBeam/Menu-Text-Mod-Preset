# Custom Menu Text v3.1.3
# by Arti
# Special Thanks: Kyle1413, Alphie
#
# Use # for comments!
# Separate entries with empty lines; a random one will be picked each time the menu loads.
# Appears just like in the vanilla game (except not quite because the vanilla logo is an image now):
# Entries with a number of lines other than 2 won't be colored by default.
# Color them yourself with formatting!
# You can override the colors even when the text is 2 lines, plus do a lot of other stuff!

# Hi yall Raz0r here! I hope you enjoy these menu text things. If your looking in here congrats! You're a kool kid!
# Make sure to get the latest menu texts from #pc-mods and the newest texts from #other-files!
